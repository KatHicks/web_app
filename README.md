# Basic Web Application
### Makers Academy Week No. 3

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/KatHicks/web_app/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/KatHicks/web_app)

### Instructions

We worked through the challenges throughout the week in rotating pairs.

* Aim of this first project of the week was to get us familiar with the basic structure of a web application
  * Was the first time that most of us had worked with a web framework so was useful to get a basic grasp of routes and views

### Objectives

* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?
* **Can you build a web app?**

### Using my application

* Download the source code using `$ git clone`
* Navigate inside the root directory using `$ cd`
* Run the command `$ bundle` inside the root directory to install all the dependencies
* Type `$ shotgun app.rb` in the command line to run the app locally
* Navigate to `localhost:9393` in a web browser to view the app

### Running the tests

* Controversially, no tests were written for this repo
* After building this app, we moved onto a second challenge for the week: [Battle](https://github.com/KatHicks/battle)
  * Our battle app was much more fully realised and was test-driven

### Dependencies

* Application written in **Ruby 2.3.3**
* Used the **Sinatra** web framework
* Used the **Shotgun** gem so that changes made in development were automatically run on the local server
